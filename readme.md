# Background and Overview
We know the most famous landmarks because of the hype but do we really know what the history of the landmarks is? Well LearnIt helps you learn about the worlds most famous landmarks. You will be able to see the globe with countries that have famous landmarks colored in blue. On click, you will be able to learn about the landmarks and its history. 

# Fun Fact
You can select your color mode either dark 🌙 or light ☀️. It will store your mode locally and next time you visit the project, your pre-selected mode will still be in effect 🤯.
